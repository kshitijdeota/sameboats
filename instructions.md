### TRAJECTORIES

This visualization presents an interactive narrative overview of one or more individuals’ movements through space over time. The timeline function allows for the researcher to consider specific periods or phases. You can select figures individually or you can compare them to others by selecting them.

<p>1. Select a range of time by clicking and dragging one of the dots or "handles" at the bottom or top of the timeline slider in the "Select Range" column. Notice that the header dates change at the top of the slider as you move either of the handles.</p>
<p>2. Select one or more authors on the "Select Authors" column. Once selected, you can deselect an author by clicking on their name again.</p>

<p>3. Once the map has been drawn, you can select any dot on the map to read a pop-up note about that particular moment in time for that particular author.</p>

### INTERSECTIONS

This visualization presents an interactive snapshot overview of the world map that reflects the presence of Afro-Atlantic figures in particular geographical locations at particular points in time. Clicking on a given city reveals which figures were present in that place and when they were there. We have worked to preserve a sense of ambiguity when a range of time is not certain. This uncertainty is indicated via the transparent aura encircling each dot. The size of the aura indicates the level of ambiguity.

<p>1. Select a range of time by clicking and dragging one of the dots or "handles" at the bottom or top of the timeline slider in "Select Range." Notice that the time frame changes at the top of the column as you move either of the handles.</p>
<p>2. Select a dot on the map to see what figures were at that spot in the same time range.</p>

### GET ON THE MAP

Same Boats is a fundamentally collaborative venture—an invitation of sorts meant to provide our community with the opportunity to participate in the development of a unique platform and to imagine research projects and pedagogical initiatives that transgress the geo-political borders separating the various nations of the Americas. 

If you’re interested in being a part of this project by proposing an additional figure or in working with one of our existing figures/editors, please contact us at thesameboats@gmail.com.
