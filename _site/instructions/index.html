Clicking on a given city reveals which figures were present in that place and when they were there. We have worked to preserve a sense of ambiguity when a range of time is not certain. This uncertainty is indicated via the transparent aura encircling each dot. The size of the aura indicates the level of ambiguity.</p><p>1.
